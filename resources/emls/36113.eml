Dear John,
 
Think election season is far away? Think again! VoteVets.org PAC is gearing up for both the 2011 and 2012 elections, when we expect to be as active as ever. As always, we'll find and support veterans running for office, run strong ads supporting those who support us, and hard-hitting ones that expose those who don't support troops and veterans. But, to do this, we need your help.
 *
**CLICK HERE TO DONATE TO VOTEVETS.ORG PAC* [ http://www.actblue.com/page/votevetspac ]
 
Here's some of what your money will go towards:

  * Identifying veterans running for office who can use our support, and making direct donations to them 
  * On-the-ground organizing efforts 
  * Canvassing states and districts for veterans who want to get active in a campaign, and drive them to the polls 
  * VoteVets.org ads and mailers that pull no punches, which we've become well known for 



That's just a small sampling of where your donations will go. As a VoteVets.org PAC supporter, we'll keep you up to date on everything we do, everyone we endorse, and every politician not friendly to troops and veterans who we work against. 

*CLICK HERE TO HELP VOTEVETS.ORG PAC* [ http://www.actblue.com/page/votevetspac ]

On the calendar, elections look pretty far away. But, it takes months and months of organizing and prep work to be ready for the fast and furious election cycle. So, we're ready to hit the ground running, right now. Can we count on you to start us off with a bang? Please click the link above, and as always, we thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

Ashwin Madia
Iraq War Veteran
